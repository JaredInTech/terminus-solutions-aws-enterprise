> Building a production-ready, multi-account AWS infrastructure for a fictional technology consulting firm. This comprehensive project demonstrates enterprise cloud architecture best practices through 13 hands-on labs that I have developed after around 600 hours over the past 3 months, complete with detailed documentation, diagrams, screenshots, real-world cost analysis, IaC, and more.  I am also working on a YouTube channel to highlight this project as well as provide labs, tutorials, and all-encompassing personal and professional development strategies related to everything cloud.

## Project Highlights

- **Enterprise-Scale Architecture**: Multi-account, multi-region infrastructure supporting 99.99% availability
- **Security First**: Zero-trust architecture with defense in depth across all layers
- **Cost Optimized**: 92% cost savings compared to traditional enterprise solutions
- **Fully Documented**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), cost analysis, and implementation guides
- **Real Implementation**: Working infrastructure with proof of concepts, not just theory

## What I'm Building

This repository contains the complete implementation of an enterprise AWS infrastructure for **Terminus Solutions**, a fictional technology consulting firm that needs:

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Multi-Account Strategy**: AWS Organizations with Production, Development, and Security accounts
- ✅ **Global Networking**: Multi-region VPC architecture with VPC Peering
- 🚧 **Compute Platform**: Auto-scaling EC2 fleets with mixed instance policies
- 📅 **Storage Strategy**: Multi-purpose S3 bucket architecture with cross-region replication for DR
- 📅 **Data Layer**: Aurora Serverless with cross-region replication
- 📅 **Content Delivery**: CloudFront with Route53 for global performance

### Modern Application Architecture
- 📅 **Containerization**: ECS Fargate for serverless containers and EKS cluster for Kubernetes workloads
- 📅 **Serverless**: Lambda functions with API Gateway
- 📅 **Event-Driven**: SQS, SNS, and EventBridge for decoupling
- 📅 **Observability**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, and Systems Manager

### Enterprise Security & Governance
- ✅ **Identity & Access**: Cross-account roles with MFA enforcement
- ✅ **Compliance**: CloudTrail organization trail with 7-year retention
- 📅 **Threat Detection**: GuardDuty, Security Hub, and Config
- 📅 **Infrastructure as Code**: CloudFormation and Terraform

> **Security Note:** All AWS account IDs, email addresses, and sensitive information in this repository are **redacted or fictional** for security compliance.

## 💰 Cost Analysis

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade AWS architecture with intentional cost optimization strategies.

### Actual Infrastructure Costs

| Component | Development | Production | Optimization Applied |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------------------|
| **ALB** | ~$18/mo | ~$25-40/mo | Right-sized LCU allocation |
| **EC2 (Auto Scaling Group)** | ~$15/mo (t3.micro) | ~$60-150/mo | Spot-ready ASG configuration |
| **RDS MySQL** | ~$15/mo (Single-AZ) | ~$30-60/mo (Multi-AZ) | GP3 storage, auto-scaling |
| **S3 + CloudFront** | ~$5-10/mo | ~$15-50/mo | Lifecycle policies, caching |
| **Route 53** | ~$1-2/mo | ~$2-5/mo | Alias records (free queries) |
| **NAT Gateway** | ~$32/mo | ~$32-65/mo | VPC endpoints reduce traffic |
| **CloudWatch** | ~$3-5/mo | ~$10-20/mo | Custom metrics, log retention |
| **Secrets Manager** | ~$1/mo | ~$2-5/mo | Consolidated secrets |
| **Total Estimate** | **~$90-100/mo** | **~$200-400/mo** | |

*Costs vary based on traffic, data transfer, and region. Estimates based on us-east-1 pricing as of 2025.*
