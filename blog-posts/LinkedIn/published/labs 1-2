# LinkedIn Blog Post: Labs 1 & 2 Release

**December 03, 2025**

---

Two days ago I introduced Terminus Solutions, a project I've spent 3 months and 600 hours building because I couldn't find what I needed when I started learning cloud: a complete example of enterprise AWS architecture that shows not only the architecture itself (and which buttons to click) but how companies actually think about the cloud.

Today, the first release is live.

✅ Lab 1: IAM & Organizations Foundation 
Multi-account structure with Production, Development, and Security accounts. Service Control Policies that enforce guardrails organization-wide. Cross-account roles with MFA enforcement. Organization-wide CloudTrail for audit logging.

✅ Lab 2: VPC & Networking Core 
Multi-region architecture; three-tier subnet design with true database isolation. Redundant NAT Gateways per AZ. Cross-region VPC peering for DR. Defense-in-depth with NACLs and Security Groups. VPC endpoints for private AWS service access.

Each lab includes Architecture Decision Records, architecture diagrams, cost analysis, troubleshooting guides, testing checklists, and implementation proof.

The project now has a home:

Labs 3-13 roll out over the coming days. Next up: EC2 & Auto Scaling.
