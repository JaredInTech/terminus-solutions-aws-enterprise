# LinkedIn Blog Post: Labs 5 & 6 Release

**December 22, 2025**

---

Last week I released Labs 3 & 4 of Terminus Solutions - the enterprise AWS architecture project I built because I couldn't find what I needed when learning cloud: comprehensive documentation that shows not just what to build, but how companies actually think about infrastructure decisions.


Today, the data and global delivery layers are live.


✅ **Lab 5: RDS & Database Services**

Multi-AZ RDS MySQL with synchronous replication and automatic failover. Read replicas distributed across AZs for DR. Aurora Serverless variable workloads with auto-scaling capacity. DynamoDB global tables for session management with sub-millisecond latency. ElastiCache Redis.  Secrets Manager with credential rotation. 


✅ **Lab 6: Route 53 & CloudFront Distribution**

Global CDN. Multi-origin CloudFront architecture serving static content from S3, dynamic content from ALB, and media assets with optimized caching. Origin groups for automatic failover. Route 53 with health checks, latency-based routing, and geolocation policies. AWS WAF at the edge.  Lambda@Edge injecting security headers on every response. SSL/TLS certificates via ACM with auto-renewal.


What makes this different from typical tutorials:


📋 **Architecture Decision Records** 


💰 **Real Cost Analysis**


🔧 **Operational Documentation**


🧪 **Testing Checklists**


The infrastructure continues building on itself. Database endpoints are ready for application integration. CloudFront origins are configured for the ALB from Lab 3. Route 53 health checks are monitoring the entire stack. WAF rules are protecting at the edge. Each lab creates integration points for what comes next.


Labs 7-8 (ELB & Lambda/API Gateway) are currently in progress, rolling out over the coming days.
