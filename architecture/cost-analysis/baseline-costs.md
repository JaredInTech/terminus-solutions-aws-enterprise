### 🛠️ Cost Optimization Strategies

#### ⚡ Immediate Optimizations (Implement during lab)
```bash
# 1. CloudTrail Log Lifecycle Management
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration \
  --bucket terminus-cloudtrail-logs-xxx \
  --lifecycle-configuration '{
    "Rules": [{
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Filter": {"Prefix": "AWSLogs/"},
      "Transitions": [
        {
          "Days": 30,
          "StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
        },
        {
          "Days": 90, 
          "StorageClass": "GLACIER"
        },
        {
          "Days": 365,
          "StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
        }
      ]
    }]
  }'

# 2. CloudWatch Logs Retention Policy
aws logs put-retention-policy \
  --log-group-name TerminusOrganizationCloudTrail \
  --retention-in-days 90  # vs default indefinite retention

# 3. S3 Intelligent Tiering
aws s3api put-bucket-intelligent-tiering-configuration \
  --bucket terminus-cloudtrail-logs-xxx \
  --id EntireBucket \
  --intelligent-tiering-configuration '{
    "Id": "EntireBucket",
    "Status": "Enabled", 
    "Filter": {"Prefix": ""},
    "OptionalFields": ["BucketKeyStatus"]
  }'
```

#### 📅 Ongoing Cost Management
```yaml
Monthly Cost Review Process:
  Week 1: "CloudTrail Cost Analysis"
    - Review log volume trends
    - Assess data event necessity
    - Evaluate regional trail requirements
    
  Week 2: "Storage Optimization Review"  
    - Monitor S3 lifecycle transitions
    - Validate Glacier retrieval patterns
    - Assess retention policy effectiveness
    
  Week 3: "CloudWatch Logs Analysis"
    - Review log group utilization
    - Optimize retention periods
    - Consolidate low-value log streams
    
  Week 4: "Forecasting and Budgeting"
    - Project next month's costs
    - Adjust budgets and alerts
    - Plan for seasonal variations
```

### 🏆 Enterprise Cost Comparison

#### 🤖 DIY vs. Enterprise Identity Tools
```
Option 1: AWS-Native Approach (This Lab)
├── Setup Cost: $0 (engineer time only)
├── Annual Ongoing: $60-1,000 (depending on scale)
├── Maintenance: 2-4 hours/month
└── Compliance: Manual processes required

Option 2: SailPoint + CyberArk Enterprise
├── Setup Cost: $500K-2M (implementation + licenses)
├── Annual Ongoing: $1M-5M (licensing + support)
├── Maintenance: Dedicated team required
└── Compliance: Automated reporting and attestation

Break-even Analysis:
- Small org (1-100 people): AWS-native approach preferred
- Medium org (100-1,000 people): Hybrid approach often optimal
- Large org (1,000+ people): Enterprise tools become cost-effective
```

#### 💵 Total Cost of Ownership (3-year projection)
```
AWS-Native Multi-Account (This Lab Scaled):
Year 1: $500 (infrastructure) + $50K (engineer time) = $50.5K
Year 2: $800 (infrastructure) + $30K (maintenance) = $30.8K  
Year 3: $1,200 (infrastructure) + $30K (maintenance) = $31.2K
Total 3-year TCO: $112.5K

Enterprise Identity Platform:
Year 1: $1.5M (platform + implementation) + $200K (team) = $1.7M
Year 2: $1.2M (licensing) + $300K (operations) = $1.5M
Year 3: $1.2M (licensing) + $300K (operations) = $1.5M  
Total 3-year TCO: $4.7M

Cost Difference: $4.6M over 3 years
```

#### 🤖 Cost Optimization Automation
```python
# Example: Automated CloudWatch Logs cleanup
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def optimize_cloudwatch_costs():
    """Remove old log streams and optimize retention"""
    
    logs_client = boto3.client('logs')
    
    # Get all log groups
    log_groups = logs_client.describe_log_groups()
    
    for group in log_groups['logGroups']:
        group_name = group['logGroupName']
        
        # Set appropriate retention based on group type
        if 'dev' in group_name:
            retention_days = 30  # Development logs
        elif 'prod' in group_name:
            retention_days = 365  # Production logs
        else:
            retention_days = 90   # Default retention
            
        # Apply retention policy
        logs_client.put_retention_policy(
            logGroupName=group_name,
            retentionInDays=retention_days
        )
        
    print(f"Optimized {len(log_groups['logGroups'])} log groups")
