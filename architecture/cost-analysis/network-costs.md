### 🛠️ Cost Optimization Strategies

#### ⚡ Immediate Optimizations (Quick Wins)
```bash
# 1. Single NAT Gateway for Development
# Save: $65.70/month per removed NAT Gateway
aws ec2 delete-nat-gateway \
  --nat-gateway-id nat-xxxxxx \
  --region us-east-1

# 2. Schedule NAT Gateway deletion for off-hours
# Save: ~$20/month (8 hours/day deletion)
#!/bin/bash
# Cron job for 6 PM deletion
aws ec2 delete-nat-gateway --nat-gateway-id $NAT_ID
# Cron job for 8 AM creation
aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
  --subnet-id $PUBLIC_SUBNET \
  --allocation-id $EIP_ALLOC

# 3. Implement S3 Gateway Endpoint
# Save: NAT Gateway data processing charges
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-xxxxx \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.region.s3 \
  --route-table-ids rtb-xxxxx
```

Year 3: $4,500 (scale) + $10K (maintenance) = $14.5K
Total 3-year TCO: $52.1K

Enterprise Architecture (Transit Gateway + Direct Connect):
Year 1: $30K (network) + $100K (implementation) = $130K
Year 2: $35K (network) + $50K (operations) = $85K
