### 🛠️ Cost Optimization Strategies

#### ⚡ Immediate Optimizations (Quick Wins)
```bash
# 1. Single NAT Gateway for Development
# Save: $65.70/month per removed NAT Gateway
aws ec2 delete-nat-gateway \
  --nat-gateway-id nat-xxxxxx \
  --region us-east-1

# 2. Schedule NAT Gateway deletion for off-hours
# Save: ~$20/month (8 hours/day deletion)
#!/bin/bash
# Cron job for 6 PM deletion
aws ec2 delete-nat-gateway --nat-gateway-id $NAT_ID
# Cron job for 8 AM creation
aws ec2 create-nat-gateway \
  --subnet-id $PUBLIC_SUBNET \
  --allocation-id $EIP_ALLOC

# 3. Implement S3 Gateway Endpoint
# Save: NAT Gateway data processing charges
aws ec2 create-vpc-endpoint \
  --vpc-id vpc-xxxxx \
  --service-name com.amazonaws.region.s3 \
  --route-table-ids rtb-xxxxx
```

#### 📊 Traffic Analysis and Optimization
```python
# Analyze VPC Flow Logs for optimization opportunities
import boto3
import json
from collections import defaultdict

def analyze_network_costs():
    """Identify high-cost network patterns"""
    
    logs_client = boto3.client('logs')
    
    # Query for cross-AZ traffic
    cross_az_query = """
    fields srcaddr, dstaddr, bytes
    | filter srcaddr like /10.0.1./ and dstaddr like /10.0.2./
    | stats sum(bytes) as cross_az_bytes by bin(1h)
    """
    
    # Query for NAT Gateway traffic
    nat_query = """
    fields srcaddr, dstaddr, bytes
    | filter dstaddr not like /10./
    | stats sum(bytes) as internet_bytes by srcaddr
    | sort internet_bytes desc
    """
    
    # Identify top talkers
    results = logs_client.start_query(
        logGroupName='/aws/vpc/flowlogs/production',
        startTime=int((datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).timestamp()),
        endTime=int(datetime.now().timestamp()),
        queryString=nat_query
    )
    
    return {
        'recommendations': [
            'Move high-traffic services to same AZ',
            'Add VPC endpoints for AWS services',
            'Implement caching for external API calls'
        ]

```

#### 💵 Total Network TCO (3-year projection)
```
Current Architecture (Multi-Region HA):
Year 1: $3,600 (network) + $20K (engineer time) = $23.6K
Year 2: $4,000 (growth) + $10K (maintenance) = $14K  
Year 3: $4,500 (scale) + $10K (maintenance) = $14.5K
Total 3-year TCO: $52.1K

Enterprise Architecture (Transit Gateway + Direct Connect):
Year 1: $30K (network) + $100K (implementation) = $130K
Year 2: $35K (network) + $50K (operations) = $85K
Year 3: $40K (network) + $50K (operations) = $90K  
Total 3-year TCO: $305K

Cloud-Native vs Traditional Network:
Traditional MPLS Network: $500K-2M over 3 years
AWS Network (optimized): $52K-305K over 3 years
Savings: 70-90% reduction in network costs
```

### 📊 Real-World Budget Planning

#### 💼 Network Budget Allocation Guidelines
```
Cloud Infrastructure Budget Impact:
├── Network Services: 15-25% of total AWS spend
├── Data Transfer: 10-30% of network budget  
├── NAT Gateways: 40-60% of network budget
├── VPC Endpoints: 5-15% of network budget
└── Monitoring: 5-10% of network budget

Typical Enterprise AWS Network Budget:
Small Org (<$10K/month AWS): $1-2K/month network
Medium Org ($10-100K/month AWS): $5-15K/month network
Large Org (>$100K/month AWS): $20-50K/month network

    # Check NAT Gateway utilization
    nat_gateways = ec2.describe_nat_gateways()
    
    for nat in nat_gateways['NatGateways']:
        nat_id = nat['NatGatewayId']
        
        # Get bandwidth metrics
        response = cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
            Namespace='AWS/EC2',
            MetricName='BytesOutToDestination',
            Dimensions=[{'Name': 'NatGatewayId', 'Value': nat_id}],
            StartTime=datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=24),
            EndTime=datetime.now(),
            Period=3600,
            Statistics=['Sum']
        )
        
        # If low utilization in dev environment, delete
        if 'dev' in nat.get('Tags', {}).get('Environment', ''):
            daily_bytes = sum([point['Sum'] for point in response['Datapoints']])
            if daily_bytes < 1073741824:  # Less than 1GB/day
                print(f"Low utilization NAT Gateway {nat_id} - consider deletion")
                
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Network optimization complete')
