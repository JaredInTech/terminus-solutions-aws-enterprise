## 🎨 Architecture Diagrams

### Overview Diagrams
- **[Architecture Overview](./diagrams/architecture-overview.png)** - Complete multi-region enterprise architecture showing all 13 labs integrated
- **[IAM Architecture](./diagrams/iam-architecture.png)** - Multi-account organizational structure with IAM roles and policies
- **[VPC Architecture](./diagrams/vpc-architecture.png)** - Network architecture with multi-region VPC design
- **[EC2 Architecture](./diagrams/ec2-architecture.png)** - Compute platform with auto-scaling groups and load balancing

### Diagram Standards
- **Color Coding**: Consistent service colors matching AWS documentation
- **Layout**: Logical and clearly define boundaries showing isolation and connection when necessary
- **Detail Level**: Balance between clarity and completeness
- **Tools Used**: draw.io for consistency and editability

## 📊 Cost Analysis

My cost analysis provides detailed projections for organizations of different sizes:

### Available Analysis
- **[Baseline Costs](./cost-analysis/baseline-costs.md)** - Foundation services costs (IAM, Organizations, CloudTrail)

### Cost Categories Covered
- **Small Organization**: 3-5 accounts, ~$60/year
- **Medium Organization**: 10-20 accounts, ~$540-1,020/year  
- **Enterprise Organization**: 50+ accounts, ~$9,600-27,600/year

### Key Insights
- 92% cost savings vs traditional enterprise tools (SailPoint, CyberArk)
- Detailed optimization strategies for each service
- ROI calculations and business justification

## 📋 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document key architectural decisions with context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

### Current ADRs
- **[ADR-001: Multi-Account Strategy](./decisions/adr-001-multi-account-strategy.md)** - Foundation for account structure and governance
- **[ADR Template](./decisions/adr-template.md)** - Standard template for future decisions

### Planned ADRs
- ADR-002: VPC Architecture and Network Segmentation
- ADR-003: Container Platform Selection (ECS vs EKS)
- ADR-004: Database Strategy (RDS vs Aurora vs DynamoDB)
- ADR-005: Monitoring and Observability Approach

### ADR Process
1. Copy `adr-template.md` to `adr-NNN-brief-description.md`
2. Status starts as "Proposed"
3. Update to "Accepted" after review
4. Link from relevant lab documentation

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

This project follows these core architectural principles:

### 1. **Security First**
- Multi-account strategy for blast radius isolation
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Zero-trust network architecture
- Encryption by default

### 2. **High Availability**
- Multi-AZ deployments in production
- Multi-region DR capability
- Automated failover mechanisms
- 99.99% availability target

### 3. **Cost Optimization**
- Right-sizing based on actual usage
- Automated resource cleanup
- Lifecycle policies for data
- Reserved capacity where appropriate

### 4. **Operational Excellence**
- Infrastructure as Code for everything
- Automated monitoring and alerting
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Comprehensive documentation

### 5. **Scalability**
- Auto-scaling for all applicable services
- Loosely coupled microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Global content delivery

## 🤝 Contributing

When adding architectural documentation:
1. **Diagrams**: Use draw.io and export as PNG with source
2. **ADRs**: Follow the template and link to implementations
3. **Cost Analysis**: Include real AWS pricing with date
4. **Updates**: Keep README sections current

## 📅 Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: Update implementation status
- **Monthly**: Review and update cost projections
- **Quarterly**: Reassess architectural decisions
- **Annually**: Major architecture review
