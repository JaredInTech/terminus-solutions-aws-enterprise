# ADR-004: Multi-Region DR Network Design

## Date
2025-06-12

## Status
Accepted

## Context
With our network segmentation architecture defined (ADR-003), Terminus Solutions needs to establish network connectivity between our primary region (us-east-1) and disaster recovery region (us-west-2). This decision is critical for enabling database replication, application failover, and maintaining business continuity with our target RTO of 4 hours and RPO of 1 hour.

Key requirements and constraints:
- Must support cross-region RDS read replica replication
- Need secure, private connectivity (no internet traversal)
- Require <100ms latency for database replication
- Support future application-level data synchronization
- Budget conscious - avoid unnecessary ongoing costs
- Current scale: 2 regions (may expand to 4-5 regions within 2 years)
- Must maintain network isolation between environments
- Support bidirectional communication for failover scenarios
- Enable Route 53 health checks across regions

Business context:
- 99.9% uptime SLA requires multi-region capability
- Compliance requires data residency in multiple geographic locations
- Cost sensitivity: DR can use smaller resources but network must be ready
- Team size: 15 people (limited operational overhead tolerance)

## Decision
We will implement VPC Peering for cross-region connectivity between Production (us-east-1) and DR (us-west-2) regions.

**Architecture:**
- Point-to-point VPC peering connection
- Full mesh not required (only 2 regions currently)
- DNS resolution enabled for cross-region name resolution
- Routing tables updated in both VPCs
- Security groups use CIDR blocks (not SG references across regions)

**Connection Details:**
```
Production VPC (10.0.0.0/16) <--Peering--> DR VPC (10.1.0.0/16)
Connection: Encrypted over AWS backbone
Bandwidth: No artificial limits
Cost: $0.02/GB data transfer
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Simplicity**: Direct connection, easy to understand and troubleshoot
- **Cost Effective**: No hourly charges, only data transfer costs
- **Performance**: Uses AWS backbone, typically <70ms coast-to-coast
- **Security**: Traffic never traverses internet, encrypted by default
- **Reliability**: No single point of failure, AWS-managed service
- **Quick Setup**: Can be established in minutes
- **No Bandwidth Limits**: Scales with application needs

### Negative
- **No Transitive Routing**: Cannot route through one VPC to reach another
- **Limited to 2 Regions**: Would need mesh topology for more regions
- **CIDR Management**: Must use IP addresses in security groups
- **Manual Routes**: Route tables must be updated manually
- **Future Refactoring**: May need to migrate to Transit Gateway later

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear network diagrams showing peering
- **Automation**: Use IaC to manage route table updates
- **Planning**: Reserve Transit Gateway CIDR space for future
- **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch metrics for peering connection

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. AWS Transit Gateway
**Rejected because:**
- Overkill for 2 regions ($0.05/hour + $0.02/GB vs $0.02/GB only)
- Additional ~$73/month in hourly charges
- Added complexity not justified at current scale
- 10-20ms additional latency
- Can migrate to this when we have 4+ regions

### 2. VPN Over Internet
**Rejected because:**
- Security concerns with internet traversal
- Variable latency and bandwidth
- Complex key management
- IPSec overhead reduces throughput
- Not suitable for production database replication

### 3. AWS Direct Connect
**Rejected because:**
- Extremely expensive for DR use case
- Long provisioning time (weeks to months)
- Requires physical infrastructure commitment
- Overkill for current bandwidth needs
- Better suited for hybrid cloud

### 4. Application-Level Replication Only
**Rejected because:**
- Misses infrastructure-level connectivity needs
- Cannot use native RDS read replicas
- Requires custom application logic
- Higher RPO than required
- More complex failover procedures

### 5. No DR Connectivity (Cold DR)
**Rejected because:**
- Cannot meet 4-hour RTO requirement
- No continuous data replication
- Requires full backup/restore for failover
- Unacceptable RPO for business needs
- Does not demonstrate enterprise practices

## Implementation Details

### VPC Peering Configuration
```yaml
Peering Connection:
  Name: Terminus-Production-DR-Peering
  Requester VPC: vpc-xxxxx (DR VPC in us-west-2)
  Accepter VPC: vpc-yyyyy (Production VPC in us-east-1)
  DNS Resolution: Enabled bidirectionally
  Status: Active
```

### Route Table Updates
**Production VPC Routes:**
- Add: 10.1.0.0/16 → pcx-xxxxx (all route tables)

**DR VPC Routes:**
- Add: 10.0.0.0/16 → pcx-xxxxx (all route tables)

### Security Group Modifications
```yaml
Production Database SG:
  - Add inbound MySQL (3306) from 10.1.11.0/24 (DR app subnet)
  - Add inbound MySQL (3306) from 10.1.12.0/24 (DR app subnet)

DR Database SG:
  - Add inbound MySQL (3306) from 10.0.11.0/24 (Prod app subnet)
  - Add inbound MySQL (3306) from 10.0.12.0/24 (Prod app subnet)
```

### Cost Analysis
```
Monthly Costs (Estimated):
- VPC Peering: $0 (no hourly charges)
- Data Transfer: ~$20/month (assuming 1TB replication)
- Total: $20/month

Compared to Transit Gateway:
- TGW Hourly: $73/month (2 attachments)
- Data Transfer: $20/month
- Total: $93/month
- Savings: $73/month (78% lower)
```

### Future Migration Path
```
Current State (2 regions):
  Production VPC <--Peering--> DR VPC
  Monthly Cost: $20

Future State (4+ regions):
  All VPCs <---> Transit Gateway <---> All VPCs
  Monthly Cost: ~$180
  Migration Trigger: When peering mesh becomes complex
```

### DR Activation Procedures
1. **Health Check Failure**: Route 53 detects production failure
2. **DNS Update**: Route 53 updates records to DR endpoints
3. **Database Promotion**: RDS read replica promoted to master
4. **Application Scaling**: Auto Scaling groups in DR region activate
5. **Verification**: Synthetic monitors confirm DR functionality

*This decision will be revisited if:*
- We expand beyond 3 regions (mesh complexity)
- Monthly data transfer exceeds $100 (TGW may be cost-effective)
- We need transitive routing for shared services
- AWS significantly reduces Transit Gateway pricing
