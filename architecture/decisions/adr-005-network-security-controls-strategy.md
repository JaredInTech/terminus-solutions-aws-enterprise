# ADR-005: Network Security Controls Strategy

## Date
2025-06-12

## Status
Accepted

## Context
With our three-tier network architecture established (ADR-003) and cross-region connectivity defined (ADR-004), Terminus Solutions needs to implement comprehensive network security controls. This decision determines how we'll protect our infrastructure from threats while maintaining operational flexibility and meeting compliance requirements.

Key requirements and constraints:
- Must implement defense-in-depth security strategy
- Need to protect against common attacks (DDoS, port scanning, unauthorized access)
- Require detailed audit trails for security incidents
- Support developer productivity without compromising security
- Future compliance requirements (SOC2, HIPAA) demand network monitoring
- Limited security team - controls must be manageable
- Must distinguish between subnet-level and instance-level controls
- Balance security with performance and cost
- Need visibility into all network traffic for troubleshooting

Current security challenges:
- Stateful vs stateless rule management complexity
- Cross-region security group limitations
- Ephemeral port handling for return traffic
- East-west traffic control between tiers
- Audit and compliance logging requirements

## Decision
We will implement a layered network security strategy using both Network ACLs (subnet-level) and Security Groups (instance-level), complemented by VPC Flow Logs for monitoring.

**Security Layers:**
1. **Network ACLs** - Stateless subnet perimeter defense
2. **Security Groups** - Stateful instance-level protection  
3. **VPC Flow Logs** - Comprehensive traffic monitoring
4. **Route Tables** - Traffic flow control (implicit security)

**Implementation Strategy:**
```
Internet → [NACL] → [Security Group] → Instance
   ↓          ↓            ↓              ↓
Coarse    Subnet      Instance      Application
Filter    Defense      Defense        Level
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- Default deny with explicit allow rules
- Least privilege access between tiers
- Security group chaining using references (not IPs)
- Stateless rules for subnet boundaries
- Comprehensive logging of all traffic

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against breaches
- **Granular Control**: Can apply different policies at subnet and instance levels
- **Compliance Ready**: Flow logs provide complete audit trail
- **Flexibility**: Security groups can reference each other dynamically
- **Performance**: NACLs process at line rate with no performance impact
- **Troubleshooting**: Flow logs enable rapid issue diagnosis
- **Scalability**: Security group references auto-update with scaling

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Two different security models to understand
- **Ephemeral Ports**: NACL stateless nature requires explicit return rules
- **Rule Limits**: 60 inbound + 60 outbound rules per security group
- **Cross-Region Limitations**: Cannot reference SGs across regions
- **Flow Log Costs**: CloudWatch storage and analysis charges
- **Learning Curve**: Team must understand stateful vs stateless

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Documentation**: Create clear traffic flow diagrams
- **Automation**: Use IaC to manage rule consistency
- **Training**: Include security controls in onboarding
- **Monitoring**: Alert on rule changes and anomalies
- **Templates**: Pre-built security group patterns

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Security Groups Only (No NACLs)
**Rejected because:**
- Single layer of defense insufficient
- No subnet-level isolation
- Cannot block traffic before it reaches instances
- Less granular audit controls
- Doesn't meet defense-in-depth requirements

### 2. NACLs Only (No Security Groups)
**Rejected because:**
- Stateless rules too complex for applications
- No dynamic instance grouping
- Cannot use security group references
- Extremely difficult ephemeral port management
- Poor developer experience

### 3. Third-Party Firewall Appliances
**Rejected because:**
- Additional cost ($1000+/month)
- Single point of failure
- Performance bottleneck
- Complexity for current team size
- Native AWS controls sufficient

### 4. AWS Network Firewall
**Rejected because:**
- Overkill for current requirements
- Expensive (~$395/month + processing)
- Additional complexity
- Can add later if needed
- Current controls meet compliance needs

### 5. Single Security Layer (Simplified)
**Rejected because:**
- Insufficient for production workloads
- No defense against subnet-level attacks
- Cannot demonstrate enterprise practices
- Fails compliance requirements
- No proper network segmentation
