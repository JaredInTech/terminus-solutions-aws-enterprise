## Overview

These 13 labs describe an example of building an enterprise-grade AWS architecture from the ground up. Starting with foundational identity and access management, they progressively add networking, compute, storage, databases, and advanced services ending with a fully operational multi-region architecture.  Depending on feedback/demand, I will expand this project accordingly, including adding in step-by-step instructions for each lab, and video walkthroughs.

### What I'm building
- Multi-account AWS Organizations structure
- Multi-region VPC networking with DR capability
- Auto-scaling compute platform
- Secure storage and database tiers
- Global content delivery
- Serverless and container workloads
- Comprehensive monitoring and security

## 💰 Cost Summary

| Phase | Labs | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|-------|------|--------------|-------|
| Foundation | 1-2 | ~$50 | Primarily NAT Gateway costs |
| Compute & Data | 3-6 | ~$150 | EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront |
| Application | 7-10 | ~$75 | Load balancers, Lambda, monitoring |
| Operations | 11-13 | ~$100 | Security services, containers |
| **Total** | **All** | **~$375** | Production-like environment |

> **Tip:** Most resources can be stopped or deleted after each lab to minimize costs. See individual lab cost documents for optimization strategies.

## 📖 How to Use These Labs

### Getting Started
1. **Read the Overview**: Start with each lab's README.md to understand objectives
2. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure you've completed prior labs
3. **Review Costs**: Check the cost analysis before provisioning resources
4. **Follow Step-by-Step**: Execute instructions in order
5. **Validate**: Use the testing sections to verify your work
6. **Troubleshoot**: Reference troubleshooting guides for common issues

### Best Practices
- Take screenshots as you go for your own documentation
- Read the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to understand the "why"
- Don't skip the testing and validation sections
- Clean up resources when not in use to control costs
- Use the troubleshooting guides before searching elsewhere

### If You Get Stuck
1. Check the troubleshooting guide in the lab's `docs/` folder
2. Review the AWS documentation linked in each lab
3. Verify prerequisites from previous labs are complete
4. Check security group and IAM permissions
