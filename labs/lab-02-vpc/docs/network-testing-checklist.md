- [ ] Data subnet route tables have local routes only (no internet)
- [ ] Peering routes added to all route tables (10.1.0.0/16 ‚Üî 10.0.0.0/16)

## üß™ Connectivity Testing Scenarios

### 1. Public Subnet Internet Access

**Test Setup**: Launch temporary EC2 instance in public subnet

```bash
# Launch test instance
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0c94855ba95c71c0a \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
  --key-name terminus-test-key \
  --subnet-id subnet-xxxxx \
  --security-group-ids sg-xxxxx \
  --associate-public-ip-address
```

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Instance receives public IP address automatically
- [ ] Can ping external addresses
  ```bash
  ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
  ping -c 4 google.com
  ```
- [ ] Can download packages from internet repositories
  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  curl -I https://www.example.com
  ```
- [ ] SSH access works from approved IP addresses
  ```bash
  ssh -i terminus-test-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
  ```

**Expected Results**: All connectivity tests pass, latency < 50ms

---

### 2. Private Subnet NAT Gateway Access

**Test Setup**: Launch temporary EC2 instance in private application subnet

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Instance receives private IP only (no public IP)
  ```bash
  # Verify no public IP assigned
  curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
  # Should return 404
  ```
- [ ] Can reach internet via NAT Gateway for outbound traffic
  ```bash
  # Test outbound connectivity
  ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
  curl -I https://www.amazonaws.com
  ```
- [ ] Cannot be reached directly from internet
  ```bash
  # From external host - should timeout
  nc -zv <private-ip> 22
  ```
- [ ] Can download software updates and packages
  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y htop
  pip install requests
  ```

**Expected Results**: Outbound works, inbound blocked

---

### 3. Application to Database Connectivity

**Test Setup**: Test network connectivity between tiers

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Application subnet can reach database subnet on port 3306
  ```bash
  # From app instance
  nc -zv 10.0.21.5 3306
  telnet 10.0.21.5 3306
  ```
- [ ] Database subnet cannot initiate outbound internet connections
  ```bash
  # From data subnet instance - should fail
  ping 8.8.8.8
  curl https://www.google.com
  ```
- [ ] Security groups properly restrict access to database ports
  ```bash
  # From public subnet - should fail
  nc -zv 10.0.21.5 3306
  ```
- [ ] Network ACLs allow necessary traffic patterns
  ```bash
  # Verify NACL rules with VPC Flow Logs
  ```

**Expected Results**: Only app tier can reach database tier

---

### 4. Cross-Region VPC Peering

**Test Setup**: Test inter-region communication via peering

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] Production VPC can reach DR VPC subnets
  ```bash
  # From production instance
  ping -c 4 10.1.11.5
  ```
- [ ] DR VPC can reach production VPC subnets
  ```bash
  # From DR instance
  ping -c 4 10.0.11.5
  ```
- [ ] Route tables properly configured for cross-region traffic
  ```bash
  # Verify routes
  ip route | grep 10.1
  ```
- [ ] Security groups allow necessary cross-region access
  ```bash
  # Test database replication port
  nc -zv 10.1.21.5 3306
  ```

**Expected Results**: Bidirectional connectivity with ~67ms latency

---

### 5. VPC Endpoints Functionality

**Test Setup**: Test private AWS service access

**Validation Steps**:
- [ ] S3 access works without internet routing
  ```bash
  # Should not go through NAT Gateway
  aws s3 ls
  traceroute s3.amazonaws.com
  ```
- [ ] Systems Manager endpoints enable private instance management
  ```bash
  # Start SSM session from console
  # Should work without internet access
  ```
- [ ] CloudWatch logging works through VPC endpoints
  ```bash
  # Logs should appear without NAT traffic
  aws logs put-log-events ...
  ```
- [ ] No NAT Gateway charges for VPC endpoint traffic
  ```bash
  # Monitor NAT Gateway metrics
  ```

**Expected Results**: AWS services accessible without internet routing

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Testing

### Network ACL Validation

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Public NACLs allow web traffic but restrict other access
  - [ ] HTTP/HTTPS allowed from 0.0.0.0/0

- [ ] Application NACLs prevent direct internet access
  - [ ] No inbound rules from 0.0.0.0/0
  - [ ] Outbound allows specific ports only
- [ ] Database NACLs only allow application tier access
  - [ ] MySQL port only from app subnets
  - [ ] No outbound internet rules
- [ ] Ephemeral port rules configured correctly

  ```bash
  # From unauthorized source - should fail
  curl http://<web-server-ip>
  ```
- [ ] Database servers accept connections only from application tier
  ```bash
  # Test from different security groups
  ```
- [ ] No overly permissive rules (0.0.0.0/0 where inappropriate)
  ```bash
  # Audit security group rules
  aws ec2 describe-security-groups --query 'SecurityGroups[?IpPermissions[?IpRanges[?CidrIp==`0.0.0.0/0`]]]'
  ```
- [ ] Cross-region access properly restricted
  - [ ] Uses CIDR blocks, not security group references

---

### Flow Log Verification

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] VPC Flow Logs capturing all traffic types
  ```bash
  # Check CloudWatch Logs
  aws logs tail /aws/vpc/flowlogs/terminus-production
  ```
- [ ] Logs appearing in CloudWatch with correct format
- [ ] Can query logs for security analysis
  ```sql
  fields @timestamp, srcaddr, dstaddr, action
  | filter action = "REJECT"
  | stats count() by srcaddr
  ```
- [ ] Rejected connections properly logged for monitoring

## üöÄ Performance Testing

### Network Latency

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Same-AZ communication shows minimal latency
  ```bash
  # Expected: <1ms
  ping -c 100 <same-az-instance>
  ```
- [ ] Cross-AZ communication acceptable for application needs
  ```bash
  # Expected: 1-2ms
  ping -c 100 <cross-az-instance>
  ```
- [ ] Cross-region latency suitable for database replication
  ```bash
  # Expected: ~67ms (us-east-1 to us-west-2)
  ping -c 100 <cross-region-instance>
  ```
- [ ] VPC peering doesn't add significant overhead
  ```bash
  # Compare direct vs peered latency
  ```

  ---

### Throughput Testing

**Test Tools**: iperf3, dd, AWS CLI

**Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Instance-to-instance transfers meet performance requirements
  ```bash
  # Test bandwidth between instances
  iperf3 -s  # On target
  iperf3 -c <target-ip> -t 30  # On source
  ```
- [ ] NAT Gateway throughput adequate for application needs
  ```bash
  # Test outbound bandwidth
  curl -o /dev/null http://speedtest.tele2.net/1GB.zip
  ```
- [ ] Cross-region bandwidth sufficient for DR replication
  ```bash
  # Test VPC peering bandwidth
  dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=1000 | ssh <dr-instance> "cat > /dev/null"
  ```

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: Instance can't reach internet
- Check route table for default route to NAT Gateway
- Verify security group outbound rules
- Confirm NACL allows outbound traffic on required ports
- Ensure NAT Gateway is in public subnet with IGW route

**Issue**: Cross-region connectivity fails
- Verify VPC peering connection status (Active)
- Check route table entries for remote VPC CIDR
- Validate security groups allow cross-region IP ranges
- Confirm NACLs allow traffic in both directions

**Issue**: Database connections fail
- Check security group rules for database port (3306)
- Verify NACL rules for database subnet
- Confirm application and database are in correct subnets
- Test with telnet/nc before application connection

**Issue**: VPC endpoint not working
- Verify endpoint policy allows required actions
- Check route table entries for endpoint routes (Gateway)
- Confirm security groups allow HTTPS (443) to endpoints
- Ensure DNS resolution is enabled on the VPC
